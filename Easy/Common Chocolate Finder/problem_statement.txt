Problem Statement:
Shreyashee and her two friends, Twinny and Harsh, each have a collection of chocolates of various types, all sorted by their sweetness. 
They're curious to find out which types of chocolates they all have in common so they can enjoy them together. 
Help them identify these common chocolates.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer N, the number of chocolate types Shreyashee has.
The second line contains N space-separated strings, the types of chocolates Shreyashee has.
The third line contains an integer M, the number of chocolate types Twinny has.
The fourth line contains M space-separated strings, the types of chocolates Twinny has.
The fifth line contains an integer Z, the number of chocolate types Harsh has.
The sixth line contains Z space-separated strings, the types of chocolates Harsh has.

Output Format:
Output a single line containing the space-separated types of chocolates that are common among Shreyashee, Twinny, and Harsh, sorted alphabetically. 
If there are no common chocolates, print -1.

Constraints:
1 <= N, M, Z <= 10^4
Chocolate types are represented by lowercase English letters and have a length of at most 10 characters.

Sample Input 1:
Input:
3
dark milk white
2
dark almond
3
milk dark hazelnut

Output:
dark

Explanation:
Shreyashee has 3 types of chocolates: dark, milk, and white.
Twinny has 2 types of chocolates: dark and almond.
Harsh has 3 types of chocolates: milk, dark, and hazelnut.
The common chocolate type among all three friends is dark. Therefore, the output will be dark.

Sample Input 2:
Input:
2
white almond
3
dark milk hazelnut
4
caramel biscuit berry dark

Output 2:
-1

Explanation:
Shreyashee has 2 types of chocolates: white and almond.
Twinny has 3 types of chocolates: dark, milk, and hazelnut.
Harsh has 4 types of chocolates: caramel, biscuit, berry, and dark.
There are no chocolate types common among all three friends. Shreyashee does not have dark, which Twinny and Harsh have in common. Therefore, the output will be -1 to indicate no common chocolates.

Solution Code:
# Python function to find common chocolate types among three friends
def find_common_chocolates(shreyashee_chocolates, twinny_chocolates, harsh_chocolates, n1, n2, n3):

    # Initialize starting indexes for the chocolate lists of Shreyashee, Twinny, and Harsh
    i, j, k = 0, 0, 0
    common_chocolates = []

    # Iterate through the chocolate lists while all lists have elements
    while i < n1 and j < n2 and k < n3:

        # If the same chocolate type is found in all three lists, add it to the result and move ahead in all lists
        if shreyashee_chocolates[i] == twinny_chocolates[j] == harsh_chocolates[k]:
            common_chocolates.append(shreyashee_chocolates[i])
            i += 1
            j += 1
            k += 1

        # Move ahead in the list which has the smallest chocolate type
        elif shreyashee_chocolates[i] < twinny_chocolates[j]:
            i += 1
        elif twinny_chocolates[j] < harsh_chocolates[k]:
            j += 1
        else:
            k += 1

    # Print the common chocolate types if any, else print -1
    if common_chocolates:
        print(" ".join(common_chocolates))
    else:
        print("-1")


# Taking user input
N = int(input())
shreyashee_chocolates = sorted(input().split())
M = int(input())
twinny_chocolates = sorted(input().split())
Z = int(input())
harsh_chocolates = sorted(input().split())

# Calling the function with the user input
find_common_chocolates(shreyashee_chocolates, twinny_chocolates, harsh_chocolates, N, M, Z)
