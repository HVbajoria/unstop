Question:
Michael is on a mountain trip and spots various mountains of different heights. 
He wonders which mountains are taller than all the mountains to their east. 
He knows the last mountain he sees is always considered tall. 
Can you help Michael identify these tallest mountains?

Input Format:
A single line containing N, the number of mountains Michael sees.
The next line contains N space-separated integers representing the heights of the mountains from west to east.

Output Format:
A single line containing the heights of the mountains that are taller than all the mountains to their east, including the last mountain, separated by space.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^6
Height of each mountain is a positive integer less than or equal to (10^9).

Sample Test Case 1:
Input:
5
3 4 5 2 1
Output:
5 2 1
Explanation:
Michael sees 5 mountains with heights 3, 4, 5, 2, and 1 from west to east.
The first mountain (height 3) is not taller than the mountains to its east.
The second mountain (height 4) is also not taller than the mountain to its east (height 5).
The third mountain (height 5) is taller than all the mountains to its east, so it is included in the output.
The fourth mountain (height 2) is taller than the mountain to its east (height 1), so it is included.
The fifth mountain (height 1) is the last mountain, so it is always considered tall and included in the output.
Therefore, the mountains that are taller than all the mountains to their east are 5, 2, and 1.

Sample Test Case 2:
Input:
4
2 3 4 3
Output:
4 3
Explanation:
Michael sees 4 mountains with heights 2, 3, 4, and 3 from west to east.
The first and second mountains (heights 2 and 3) are not taller than the mountain to their east (height 4).
The third mountain (height 4) is taller than the mountain to its east, so it is included in the output.
The fourth mountain (height 3) is the last mountain, so it is always considered tall and included in the output.
Therefore, the mountains that are taller than all the mountains to their east are 4 and 3.

Solution Code:
# Python function to identify and print the tallest mountains
def identify_tallest_mountains():
    # Taking input for the number of mountains
    n = int(input())
    # Taking input for the heights of the mountains
    mountains = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize the tallest mountain from the right as the last mountain
    tallest_from_right = mountains[n-1]
    # Print the last mountain as it is always considered tall
    print(tallest_from_right, end=' ')
    
    # Iterate through the mountains from right to left
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        # If the current mountain is taller than the tallest mountain to its right
        if tallest_from_right < mountains[i]:
            # Print the current mountain as it is taller
            print(mountains[i], end=' ')
            # Update the tallest mountain to the current mountain
            tallest_from_right = mountains[i]

# Call the function to execute
identify_tallest_mountains()
