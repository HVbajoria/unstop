Editorial: Finding Ticket Combinations

Intuition
The problem at hand is a classic example of a combination sum problem, which is a fundamental concept in combinatorics and dynamic programming. The essence of the problem is to find all unique combinations of given ticket values that sum up to a target value, which can be likened to finding all possible ways to reach a specific total using a set of numbers. The challenge lies in handling an unlimited supply of each ticket type and ensuring that combinations are unique and in non-descending order.

Approach
The solution to this problem can be approached using dynamic programming, specifically a variation of the unbounded knapsack problem, where each ticket value can be chosen multiple times. The key idea is to use a bottom-up approach to build up a table (combinations_count) that at each index i stores the number of ways to reach the sum i using the available ticket values.
1) Initialization: Start by initializing an array combinations_count with a length of target_value + 1 to store the count of combinations for each value up to target_value. Set the first element to 1, representing the base case where the sum of 0 can be achieved in one way (by choosing no tickets).
2) Building the Combinations Count: Iterate through each ticket value. For each ticket value, update the combinations_count array for all sums that can be reached by adding the current ticket value to smaller sums already computed. This step essentially counts all possible combinations that can be made using the current and previously considered ticket values to reach each sum up to the target value.
3) Result: The value at combinations_count[target_value] gives the total number of unique combinations that sum up to the target value.

Code:
def find_ticket_combinations(ticket_values, num_ticket_types, target_value):
    combinations_count = [0] * (target_value + 1)
    combinations_count[0] = 1  # Base case

    for i in range(num_ticket_types):
        for j in range(ticket_values[i], target_value + 1):
            combinations_count[j] += combinations_count[j - ticket_values[i]]

    return combinations_count[target_value]

# Input handling
num_ticket_types = int(input().strip())
ticket_values = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
target_value = int(input().strip())

# Solution execution
combinations = find_ticket_combinations(ticket_values, num_ticket_types, target_value)
print(combinations)

Proper Explanation
1) Initialization: The combinations_count array is initialized with zeros except for the first element, which is set to 1. This setup represents that there is exactly one way to achieve a sum of 0 (by not selecting any tickets).
2) Dynamic Programming Loop: The outer loop iterates through each ticket value available. The inner loop updates the combinations_count array from the current ticket value up to the target value. For each sum j that can be reached by adding the current ticket value to a previously computed sum, the count of combinations to reach j is increased by the count of combinations to reach j - ticket_value[i]. This process accumulates the total number of ways to reach each sum up to the target value by considering all possible combinations of the ticket values provided.
3) Result Interpretation: After filling the combinations_count array, the element at the index equal to the target value (combinations_count[target_value]) contains the total number of unique combinations that can sum up to the target value. This result is then printed as the solution.
This approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations, making it suitable for handling a large number of ticket types and high target values.
